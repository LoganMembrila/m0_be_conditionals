# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? 
-For comparisons.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
-Spend more time completeing exercises.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
-At first it could be confusing to determine where to start while writing out the code using conditionals. The more technical they get, the more comparisons you have to consider and it could be overwhelming to configure all situations and outcomes. To me, the exercises were fun. Checking your work after having spent a good chunk of time on a problem and having an outcome you expected, was very rewarding.
